    10^8 operations take 1 second to get executed
    
    max int array size 10^6 (inside main func) and 10^7 globally

    max bool array size 10^7 (inside main func) and 10^8 globally

    array declared inside main will have garbage values whereas outside the main function i.e. 
    at global level the values inside the array will be set to 0 in c++ and java

    always start with brute force, better and then most optimal solution (even for the interviews)
    sometimes the problem might only have brute force and most optimal solution. Hence the levels of
    optimizing problem varies.
